# Reddit Persona Generator

This project builds rich, human-style personas by scraping a user's public Reddit activity and analyzing their tone, interests, and traits.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Given a Reddit user profile URL, this tool:

1. Scrapes their recent posts and comments
2. Uses (or mocks) a GPT model to generate a detailed user persona
3. Outputs the result into a `.txt` file inside the `outputs/` folder

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- `Python 3.10+`
- `PRAW` â€“ Reddit API wrapper
- `OpenAI` â€“ For persona generation (mocked fallback used if quota exhausted)
- `dotenv` â€“ Loads API credentials securely
